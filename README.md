The dataset consists of several audios of capuchin birds and other forests sounds to differentiate them from. This task of Audio recognition was achieved by first converting these audios to spectrograms and then feeding them into a custom deep learning model for classification. Tensorflow was used for the model and the GUI was created using Tkinter.
